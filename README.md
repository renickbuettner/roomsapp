# RoomsApp
## Web-based room managing software

I initially wrote RoomsApp for my school. Currently I'm not maintaining it anymore.

If you're using this tool, please provide a reference to this repo / initial source. If something isn't working properly or there are questions - feel free to open a ticket.

This tool uses SQLite, so you just need to setup a php server with version >7.1.
